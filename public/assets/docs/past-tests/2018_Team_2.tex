\item[1-2.] Let $T = TNYWR$. For some positive integer $k$, a circle is drawn tangent to the coordinate axes such that the lines $x + y = k^2, x + y = (k+1)^2, \dots, x+y = (k+T)^2$ all pass through it. What is the minimum possible value of $k$?

\item[2-2.] Let $T = TNYWR$. Suppose that a sequence $\{a_n\}$ is defined via $a_1 = 11, a_2 = T$, and $a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}$ for $n \ge 3$. Find $a_{19} + a_{20}$.

\item[3-2.] Let $T = TNYWR$. $T$ people each put a distinct marble into a bag; its contents are mixed randomly and one marble is distributed back to each person. Given that at least one person got their own marble back, what is the probability that everyone else also received their own marble?

\item[4-2.] Let $T = TNYWR$. Let $CMU$ be a triangle with $CM=13$, $MU=14$, and $UC=15$.  Rectangle $WEAN$ is inscribed in $\triangle CMU$ with points $W$ and $E$ on $\overline{MU}$, point $A$ on $\overline{CU}$, and point $N$ on $\overline{CM}$.  If the area of $WEAN$ is $T$, what is its perimeter?

\item[5-2.] Let $T = TNYWR$. David rolls a standard $T$-sided die repeatedly until he first rolls $T$, writing his rolls in order on a chalkboard. What is the probability that he is able to erase some of the numbers he's written such that all that's left on the board are the numbers $1, 2, \dots, T$ in order?

\begin{enumerate}

\item[6-1.] Jan rolls a fair six-sided die and calls the result $r$. Then, he picks real numbers $a$ and $b$ between 0 and 1 uniformly at random and independently. If the probability that the polynomial $\tfrac{x^2}{r} - x\sqrt{a} + b$ has a real root can be expressed as simplified fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, find $p$.

\item[7-1.] Let $ABCD$ be a unit square, and suppose that $E$ and $F$ are on $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{AB}$ such that $AE = AF = \tfrac23$. Let $\overline{CE}$ and $\overline{DF}$ intersect at $G$. If the area of $\triangle CFG$ can be expressed as simplified fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, find $p + q$.

\item[8-1.] Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=3$ and $AC=5$. Select points $D, E,$ and $F$ on $\overline{BC}$ in that order such that $\overline{AD}\perp \overline{BC}$, $\angle BAE=\angle CAE$, and $\overline{BF}=\overline{CF}$. If $E$ is the midpoint of segment $\overline{DF}$, what is $BC^2$?

\item[9-1.] Andy rolls a fair 4-sided dice, numbered 1 to 4, until he rolls a number that is less than his last roll. If the expected number of times that Andy will roll the dice can be expressed as a reduced fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, find $p + q$.

\item[10-1.] Find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\underbrace{11\dots11}_{\text{$k$ 1's}}$ is divisible by 9999.
