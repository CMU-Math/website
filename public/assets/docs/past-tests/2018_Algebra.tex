\item Misha has accepted a job in the mines and will produce one ore each day. At the market, he is able to buy or sell one ore for \$3, buy or sell bundles of three wheat for \$12 each, or \textit{sell} one wheat for one ore. His ultimate goal is to build a city, which requires three ore and two wheat. How many dollars must Misha begin with in order to build a city after three days of working?

%\item For positive real numbers $r$ and $s$, define $r \star s = \sqrt{rs}$. If
%\[x=20\star(18\star(20\star(18\star \dots))),\]
%what is the smallest integer power of $x$ greater than 1?

\item Suppose $x>1$ is a real number such that $x+\tfrac 1x = \sqrt{22}$.  What is $x^2-\tfrac1{x^2}$?

\item Let $P(x)=x^2+4x+1$.  What is the product of all real solutions to the equation $P(P(x))=0$?

%\item Among all ordered pairs of real numbers $(a,b)$ satisfying $a^2+ab+b^2=6$, compute the largest possible value of $a$.

\item 2018 little ducklings numbered 1 through 2018 are standing in a line, with each holding a slip of paper with a nonnegative number on it; it is given that ducklings 1 and 2018 have the number zero.  At some point, ducklings 2 through 2017 change their number to equal the average of the numbers of the ducklings to their left and right.  Suppose the new numbers on the ducklings sum to 1000.  What is the maximum possible sum of the original numbers on all 2018 slips?

\item Suppose $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonzero real numbers such that \[bc+\frac1a = ca+\frac2b = ab+\frac7c = \frac1{a+b+c}.\] Find $a+b+c$.

\item We call $\overline{a_n\ldots a_2}$ the Fibonacci representation of a positive integer $k$ if \[k = \sum_{i=2}^n a_i F_i,\] where $a_i\in\{0,1\}$ for all $i$, $a_n=1$, and $F_i$ denotes the $i^{\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number ($F_0=0$, $F_1=1$, and $F_i=F_{i-1}+F_{i-2}$ for all $i\ge2$). This representation is said to be \textit{minimal} if it has fewer 1â€™s than any other Fibonacci representation of $k$. Find the smallest positive integer that has eight ones in its minimal Fibonacci representation. 

\item Compute
\[\sum_{k=0}^{2017}\dfrac{5+\cos\left(\frac{\pi k}{1009}\right)}{26+10\cos\left(\frac{\pi k}{1009}\right)}.\]

\item Suppose $P$ is a cubic polynomial satisfying $P(0) = 3$ and \[(x^3 - 2x + 1 - P(x))(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4 - P(x))\leq 0\] for all $x\in\mathbb R$.  Determine all possible values of $P(-1)$.

\item Suppose $a_0,a_1,\ldots, a_{2018}$ are integers such that \[(x^2-3x+1)^{1009} = \sum_{k=0}^{2018}a_kx^k\] for all real numbers $x$.  Compute the remainder when $a_0^2 + a_1^2 + \cdots + a_{2018}^2$ is divided by $2017$.

\item Define a sequence of polynomials $F_n(x)$ by $F_0(x)=0, F_1(x)=x-1$, and for $n\geq 1$, $$F_{n+1}(x)=2xF_n(x)-F_{n-1}(x)+2F_1(x).$$ For each $n$, $F_n(x)$ can be written in the form $$F_n(x)=c_nP_1(x)P_2(x)\cdots P_{g(n)}(x)$$ where $c_n$ is a constant and $P_1(x),P_2(x)\cdots, P_{g(n)}(x)$ are non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients and $g(n)$ is as large as possible. For all $2< n< 101$, let $t$ be the minimum possible value of $g(n)$ in the above expression; for how many $k$ in the specified range is $g(k)=t$?
